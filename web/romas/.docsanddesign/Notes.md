# DEVELOPMENT NOTES
#### *RPMS Online Management System (ROMaS)*

* Raters are automatically assigned among the heads of each school, section, or division. Master teachers are sometimes assigned as raters along with the school heads/principals.
* IPCRF/OPCRF used to have been annotated by raters whenever necessary, with the annotations being used by the ratees in revising their forms. After revisions, the revised form is the only one submitted
* Annotations/proposed revisions may be implemented in any of the following ways (FOR CLARIFICATION):
  * Revisions can be interspersed into the actual responses, wherein redactions can be struck off and additions can be underscored with dotted lines (ala MS Word Review-Track Changes feature). The revisions can be tagged with annotations containing appropriate information such as the annotater's name, the date/time of the annotation, and any related comments to the revision.
  * Revisions may also be implemented as a revision history, tagged with the annotation.
* Each ratee, with the approval of the rater, will be allowed to select the KRA's and Objectives that will be included in each performance management cycle. The ratee and the rater shall agree on the performance indicators for each objective included.
* Start proposing an online (I|O)PCRF as a prototype.
  * The main interface should show what Phases each category of ratees are currently on to guide both raters and ratees on what to do.
  * Provide a checklist/tasklist for both rater and ratee that will automatically fill or be available to tick once the required forms are filled and the required activities are performed.
  * Include a way to input MFO's, KRA's, Objectives, and Performance Indicators. However, any existing data may be suggested proactively or included in available options. Should the needed items not be included among the options, ratees and raters, in agreement, can add those themselves. The ratee proposing an item and the rater clicking the <button>Approve</button> button shall constitute an agreement.
  * Once KRA's and the others are chosen, a preview of the corresponding (I|O)PCRF will be made available.
* Other forms that can be proposed:
  * Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) - Phase I
  * Performance Monitoring and Coaching Form (PMCF) - Phase II
  * Teacher-related observation and feedback forms (FOR CLARIFICATION) - when encoding, should indicate whether it is a real-time use or merely an encoding of a paper-based form - Phase II
    * Classroom Observation Tool (COT)
* A Dashboard may be introduced to display all statistics and status related to the rater, ratee, and performance management roles. (FOR CLARIFICATION)
* Timeouts may be introduced to make sure that raters and ratees commit to the accomplishment of the online IPCRF/OPCRF. (FOR CLARIFICATION)
* Timetables:
  * Teachers/School-based Personnel
    * Phase I: July 2022
    * Phase II: January 2023
    * Phase III
      * Mid-year Review: January 2023
      * Year-end Review: June 2023
    * Phase IV: June-July 2023
  * Non-school-based Personnel
    * Phase I: December 2022
    * Phase II: July 2023
    * Phase III: December 2023
    * Phase IV: December 2023
* Teachers are currently in the middle of Phase III while all others will be transitioning to Phase II on July. As such, aside from Phase I features, some [or all] features related to Phase II and Phase III shall be prioritized...
  * IPCRF/OPCRF (Phase I)
    * Allow the encoding of Office and Individual KRA's, Objectives (3 per KRA (FOR CLARIFICATION)), and Performance Indicators.
  * PMCF (Phase II)
* The names of meetings/coaching sessions related to the RPMS: (FOR CLARIFICATION)
  * Performance Planning and Commitment
  * 
* For adaptability, the system shall automatically allow the reassignment of raters at the beginning of each Phase of the Cycle, although the prevailing policy in DepEd should be obeyed. (FOR CLARIFICATION)
* KRA's for non-school-based personnel shall be clarified.
* Implementation of eSignatures for just rater and ratee. (FOR CLARIFICATION)
* User Access Levels (FOR CLARIFICATION):
  1. Basic User (Ratee View)
  2. Advanced User (Ratee View; Rater View)
  3. PMT User (Ratee View; Rater View; PM View (Summaries, Reports Generation); Logs)
  10. Maintenance User (Logs; Data Backup)
* Also add links to the RPMS Manual and other relevant info (FOR CLARIFICATION)
* Mid-Year Review (FOR CLARIFICATION)
